# Smart Agriculture system based on IoT

### Project Report:

### Project Scope:
To developed an UI for farmers, which enable them to monitor real time field parameters such as humidity, temperature and moisture, and control motor to irrigate their land.
This UI is build using node red, and IBM cloud is used to store data from IBM Watson IoT simulator(virtual sensor).
This UI would greatly help farmers to irrigate their land properly, effectively and from anywhere around the world.

### Deliverables:
Webpage to monitor and control agricultural field  and motor would be delivered with the required codes and project report.
